Misc Todos:
Appropriate durations currently excludes durations longer than bpm. This isn't stricly necessary, but those durations 
should probably be weighted down.

If ties end up too numerous, can reduce occurences with a chance to select note that fits beat division
A method that finds a fitting duration, such as a dotted note, and applies it

Remove get_appropriate_durations, and get_weight_list from measure. Instead, Rhythm will keep passing the default values based on it's time signature,
and detect when new ones need to be generated, such as for a time signature change. This way, Measure isn't doing it every instantiation

Design Decision notes:

Compose method in rhythm will create measures 1 at a time, run fill_right_hand on each, and append. Then will loop through each measure and call 
fill_left_hand from each. Or call right and left before each measure is appended. As left hand is based on right, and trends in right will get 
reflected in left, even when left is generated measure by measure.
