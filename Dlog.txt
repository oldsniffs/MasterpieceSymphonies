12/6

Getting proportions could be very complicated, and the duration lists generally won't be very dynamic. Going to
just hard code a weight for each note type for now.

The current challenge is to break down odd beat counts (ie 1.25) to complete a measure. Could find the nearest 
note, then repeat this until complete. If I can determine a duration to complete the measure, this would work with tieing carry-overs as well.



User Feedback Needed:

for tied rollover into new measure, should larger duration come first?
